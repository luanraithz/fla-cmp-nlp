# Natural language processing

> In English because every resource so far is in this language, I will translate it to portuguese when I think it's done

The study of the computational treatment of natural (human) language.

## Speaker and Listener

### Speaker
    Intention (goals, share knowledge or beliefs)
    Generation (tatical)
    Synthesis (text or speech) - Produce

### Listener
    Perception - (hear or read)
    Interpretation (syntactic, semantic, pragmatic)
        Syntatic - Gramatical structure of the sentence
        Semantic - Meaning of the sentence
        Pragmatic - Purpose of the sentence
    Incorporation (internalization, understanding)
        `When the listener take some action or learn something based on what the speaker said`

### Both
    Context (grounding)

## Basic NLP pipeline
    (`U`)nderstanding and (`G`)eneration
    Language --`U`--> Computer --`G`--> Language

## Ambiguity types (or at least some of them)

> From Beatrice Santorini's collection

### Lexical ambiguity: `A man like him is hard to find.`

Can be that the man of this kind are rare or that the are absent.

### Structural ambiguity: `It seemed her career was just taking off.`

Can be that the career was just beginning or that her career was literally "taking off" (like leaving the work behind).

### Scope ambiguity: `All in all, I cannot say enough good things about this candidate or recomend him to highly.`

`not enough` can be too few things or too many.
