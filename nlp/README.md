## Speaker and Listener

### Speaker
    Intention (goals, share knowledge or beliefs)
    Generation (tatical)
    Synthesis (text or speech) - Produce

### Listener
    Perception - (hear or read)
    Interpretation (syntactic, semantic, pragmatic)
        Syntatic - Gramatical structure of the sentence
        Semantic - Meaning of the sentence
        Pragmatic - Purpose of the sentence
    Incorporation (internalization, understanding)
        `When the listener take some action or learn something based on what the speaker said`

### Both
    Context (grounding)

## Basic NLP pipeline
    (`U`)nderstanding and (`G`)eneration
